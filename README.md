# RAG-Based AI Assistant for Technical Documentation

## Overview
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that answers user queries by retrieving relevant information from technical documents and generating contextual responses using NLP techniques.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- spaCy
- NLTK
- Embeddings
- FastAPI

## Key Features
- Document preprocessing and text chunking
- Semantic retrieval using embeddings
- Context-aware response generation
- REST API interface for query handling

## Current Status
🚧 Work in progress  
Basic document processing and retrieval pipeline implemented. Response generation and optimization in progress.

## Roadmap
- Improve retrieval accuracy
- Add vector database integration (FAISS)
- Enhance prompt design and response quality
- Extend support for multiple document formats

## Use Case
Designed to assist developers and engineers in quickly navigating and understanding large technical documentation sets.
